This is a Decentralized To Do web application which I build using Reactjs for frontend, Expressjs for Backend, and Solidity with hardhat for creating smart contract.
To start the frontend 
RUN npm i 
RUN npm start 
Environment variables:
REACT_APP_INFURA_API_KEY
REACT_APP_SERVER_URL
REACT_APP_CONTRACT_ADDRESS
REACT_APP_CONTRACTABI

To start the backend 
RUN npm i
RUN npm start
Environment variables:
INFURA_API_KEY
PRIVATE_KEY
CONTRACT_ADDRESS
CONTRACTABI

After that the app will start running.
Also you can visit this url for demo purpose I deployed the complete application on Azure App Service using Docker(for container)
